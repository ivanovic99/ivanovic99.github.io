  Worms is a replica of the game called 'Worms'. This game was made in C++ by 3 people (including myself). In order to render the game we used QT and SDL2, BOX2D to handle the physics and everything that is related to concurrency, structure of the project and testing was handmade, which I must say, that is the part where I was responsible for.
